# About The Project
This project utilizes the [NASA Mars Rover Photos API](https://api.nasa.gov/) to retrieve images captured on particular dates. Initially, I designed detailed mockups using Figma and then proceeded with the development process. It took me some time to get started as I haven't used MUI recently (I'm more of a Tailwind person ðŸ˜‰). That being said, it's functional as it stands but the styling methods could use some improvement. If I had more time, my top priority would be to integrate smooth animations [react-spring](https://www.react-spring.dev/)). I created this project as part of a coding challenge for a job application.
